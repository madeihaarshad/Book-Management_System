# Book Management System
I have modified a book management system from an open-source project already uploaded on GitHub. Using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, I added features for borrowing and returning books. Originally, it included features such as adding, removing, displaying lists, updating, and searching for books within a library.
